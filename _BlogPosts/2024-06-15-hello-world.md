Hello world this is my new static site bloging system that i made. It's similar to jekyll but it's written in python. I'm using markdown to write my blog posts! Yippie!

I'm going to use this functionality of my website to do the following:
1. post solutions to difficult bugs and problems that i've solved in hopes that it will help others
2. post about my projects and what i'm working on
3. post about my thoughts and ideas on technology and programming
4. post about my life and what i'm doing as it relates to tech
